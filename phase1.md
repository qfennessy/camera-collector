I've completed the implementation of Phase 1 of the project, which includes setting up the basic project structure following modern Python
  package layout standards. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

  1. Project Structure:
    - Created the camera_collector package with proper Python module structure
    - Set up all necessary directories for APIs, models, services, etc.
    - Added __init__.py files to make the directories proper Python packages
  2. Dependencies Management:
    - Created pyproject.toml file for Poetry
    - Configured dependencies for FastAPI, MongoDB, JWT, etc.
    - Set up development dependencies for testing and code quality
  3. Code Quality Tools:
    - Added pre-commit hooks for code formatting and linting
    - Configured Black, Ruff, and MyPy for code quality
    - Set up code style configuration in pyproject.toml
  4. Testing Infrastructure:
    - Set up pytest configuration with coverage settings
    - Created test directories mirroring the package structure
    - Added initial test for the Camera model
  5. Core Components:
    - Created basic models for Camera and User
    - Set up MongoDB database connection
    - Added custom exceptions for error handling
    - Implemented configuration management
  6. Docker Setup:
    - Added Dockerfile for containerization
    - Created docker-compose.yml for local development
    - Configured MongoDB service
  7. Utility Scripts:
    - Added database setup script to create indexes
    - Created data seeding script with sample cameras

  All these changes have been committed to the git repository. The project is now ready for Phase 2 implementation, pending your approval.
