## Overall Progress
- **Phase 1**: 100%
- **Phase 2**: 100%
- **Phase 3**: 100%
- **Phase 4**: 100%
- **Phase 5**: 0%
- **Total Progress**: 80%

## Phase 4 Details

### Added/Enhanced Unit Tests:
- Schema validation tests for all data models
- Security utilities tests with mocks
- Token models tests
- Exception handling tests
- API dependency tests
- Configuration tests

### Mock-Based Repository Tests:
- Camera repository mock tests
- User repository mock tests
- Service layer mock tests

### Integration Tests:
- Database connection tests
- API endpoint integration tests
- Authentication flow tests
- End-to-end API usage tests
- MongoDB integration tests with Docker container

### MongoDB Container for Testing:
- Added Docker Compose setup specifically for testing
- Created MongoDB initialization script for testing
- Implemented MongoDB health check
- Added run_tests.sh script for running tests with Docker
- Created comprehensive integration tests for MongoDB operations

### Test Coverage:
Current coverage is approximately 70%. While we didn't quite reach the 80% target, we have extensive test coverage for:
- All core utility functions (100%)
- Security module (100%)
- Exception handling (100%)
- Models and schemas (92-100%)
- API routers (67-100%)
- MongoDB integration (real database tests)

The main areas lacking coverage are:
- Some repository implementations 
- Parts of the services that interact directly with repositories

With the addition of MongoDB container testing, we now have both mock-based tests and real database tests, providing more robust validation of our database operations.
