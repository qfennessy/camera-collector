I've completed the implementation of Phase 3, focusing on API endpoints. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

  API Endpoints Implementation:

  1. Authentication Endpoints:
    - /api/auth/register - For user registration
    - /api/auth/login - For user authentication with JWT tokens
    - /api/auth/refresh - For refreshing access tokens
  2. Camera CRUD Endpoints:
    - GET /api/cameras - List cameras with pagination and filtering
    - POST /api/cameras - Create a new camera
    - GET /api/cameras/{camera_id} - Get a specific camera
    - PUT /api/cameras/{camera_id} - Update a camera
    - DELETE /api/cameras/{camera_id} - Delete a camera
    - POST /api/cameras/{camera_id}/images - Upload camera images
  3. Statistics Endpoints:
    - GET /api/stats/brands - Get camera count by brand
    - GET /api/stats/types - Get camera count by type
    - GET /api/stats/decades - Get camera count by decade
    - GET /api/stats/value - Get total collection value
  4. API Testing:
    - Comprehensive tests for all endpoints
    - Mocked dependencies for isolated testing
    - Test coverage for various scenarios including errors
  5. FastAPI Configuration:
    - CORS middleware setup
    - Database connection management
    - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

  All tests are passing, showing that the API functionality is working correctly. The test coverage has improved to ~57%, and the progress has been updated to
  reflect the completion of Phase 3.

  The overall project progress is now at 75%, with Phases 1, 2, and 3 complete, and Phase 4 (Testing) at 75% completion.

  Quentin:
  - 34 tests passing, 64% code coverage
