Great! We've succeeded in implementing a MongoDB container for testing our application. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

  1. Created Docker Compose Test Configuration:
    - Added docker-compose-test.yml for running tests with a real MongoDB instance
    - Configured proper MongoDB initialization, port mappings, and volume mounts
    - Added health checking to ensure MongoDB is ready before running tests
  2. Added MongoDB Initialization for Testing:
    - Created a MongoDB initialization script with sample data
    - Set up initialization of collections and indexes
    - Added test user credentials for authentication testing
  3. Created Run Tests Script:
    - Implemented run_tests.sh to orchestrate Docker-based testing
    - Added proper environment variable handling
    - Included error checking and cleanup
  4. Fixed Model Structure:
    - Added CameraCreate and CameraUpdate models for better API design
    - Fixed serialization issues for MongoDB
  5. Added Comprehensive MongoDB Integration Tests:
    - Created tests for connection verification
    - Added CRUD operation tests
    - Added query, sorting, and projection tests
  6. Updated Project Documentation:
    - Updated PROGRESS.md with MongoDB container testing information
    - Updated test status to reflect completed integration tests

  These improvements enhance the test coverage of our application, especially for database operations. The MongoDB container provides a more realistic testing
  environment that closely matches the production setup, improving the reliability of our tests and making the application more robust.
